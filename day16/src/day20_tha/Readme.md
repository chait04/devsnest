## Hooks ( useState )

- `array Destructuring` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#array_destructuring

## Events - onClick, onChange etc..

> <strong>`Events in react`</strong>

- Handling events in react is almost similary to handling events on DOM, there is just a syntax diffrence

- A good practice is to put the event handler as a method in the component

- `onClick={handleClick}` <- syntax
- `onClick={() => console.log("userClicked")}` <- syntax
