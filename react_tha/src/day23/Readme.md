# React Router

> React Router
- React router gives us three components `Route, Link, BrowserRouter` which help us to implement the routing

> Switch
- Switch component helps us to render the components only when path matches otherwise it fallbacks to the not found component.

<br>

> What is Link
- A Link is the primary way to allow users to navigate around your application. If we had a navigation bar and we put About This means that when someone clicks About in our nav Bar then this would redirect them to the About page without having to refresh the page. As well as our URL will change
